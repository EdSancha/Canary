# Canary

There's no special dependencies to run the project. I decided to use a MVVM architecture for the DetailView to manage the data conversion.  

Next steps: 

* I didn't get advantage of CoreData in case the readings are there, I'd read those first and then refresh them with the updated data from the network.
* Create a testing framework with CoreData and Mocked Network Calls. CoreData just adds an extra layer to testing classes.
